CHECK_0030_NAME="non-closed areas"
CHECK_0030_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0030_FILE="0030_non-closed_areas.php"
CHECK_0030_DESCRIPTION="By convention ways tagged with special combinations of key and value pairs are considered to be areas and are drawn as such in the map. Therefore it is necessary that they form closed loops. Non-closed areas are invisible in the map! The standard.xml file is used to determine which key-value-combinations are drawn as areas; any instance of these has to be closed-loop."

CHECK_0040_NAME="dead-ended one-ways"
CHECK_0040_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0040_FILE="0040_dead-ended_one-ways.php"
CHECK_0040_DESCRIPTION="Streets tagged as one-way must not be dead-ended (where should all the cars pile at the end of the road?). Nodes where just one-way streets begin (or end) cannot be reached (escaped from). Please note that motorways and motorway_links are considered one-way implicitly, so this check applies."

CHECK_0050_NAME="almost-junctions"
CHECK_0050_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0050_FILE="0050_almost-junctions.php"
CHECK_0050_DESCRIPTION="Streets that have (at least) one unconnected end are examined here. If such an end-node is very close to any other way an error is reported. Unconnected end-nodes should probably be connected to adjacent ways."

CHECK_0060_NAME="deprecated tags"
CHECK_0060_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0060_FILE="0060_deprecated_tags.php"
CHECK_0060_DESCRIPTION="As shown in http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Deprecated_features some tags get replaced by others as new tagging conventions evolve. Consider this as a notice, not as an error. The term 'deprecated' is deprecated; you're free to tag anything the way you like. This is just a hint for new tagging conventions that have evolved in the meantime."

CHECK_0070_NAME="missing tags"
CHECK_0070_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0070_FILE="0070_missing_tags.php"

CHECK_0120_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0120_FILE="0120_ways_without_nodes.php"
CHECK_0120_DESCRIPTION="Ways that don't consist of at least two nodes don't make much sense as they won't get rendered."

CHECK_0130_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0130_FILE="0130_islands.php"
CHECK_0130_DESCRIPTION="Any highways drawn on the map should be accessible by car starting anywhere in the world. Ferries and highways (even railway platforms) are included in this check, so almost any island in the sea should be reachable starting from the mainland."

CHECK_0140_FILE="0140_ways_with_name_without_highway.php"
CHECK_0140_DESCRIPTION="Ways tagged with a name-tag are supposed to be highways, buildings, amenities etc. So they need more tags defining the type of object. Objects having a name but none of frequently used type tags are reported in this check"

CHECK_0150_NAME="railway crossings without tag"
CHECK_0150_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0150_FILE="0150_level_crossing_without_tag.php"
CHECK_0150_DESCRIPTION="(Level)-Crossings of railways and highways should have a common node as junction that is tagged with 'railway=level_crossing' if it is a crossing where larger vehicles can cross or with 'railway=crossing' if it is a crossing just for pedestrians"

CHECK_0160_NAME="wrongly used railway crossing tag"

CHECK_0220_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0220_FILE="0220_misspelled_tags.php"
CHECK_0220_DESCRIPTION="Tags that are used very seldom and almost look like very common tags (only one character difference) are reported as a warning."

CHECK_0230_NAME="layer conflicts"
CHECK_0230_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0230_FILE="0230_layer_conflicts.php"
CHECK_0230_DESCRIPTION="Connected ways should be on the same layer. Crossings on intermediate nodes of ways on different layers are obviously wrong. Junctions on end-nodes of ways on different layers are also deprecated, but common practice. So you may ignore this part of the check and switch them off separately. Please note that bridges are set to layer +1, and tunnels to -1, anything else to layer 0 implicitly if no layer tag is present."

CHECK_0270_NAME="motorways connected directly"
CHECK_0270_ENABLED="1"
CHECK_0270_FILE="0270_motorways_connected_directly.php"
CHECK_0270_DESCRIPTION="Motorways should only be connected to other motorways or motorway_links. They should especially not be directly connected to highway=primary or highway=residential roads. Please note: This check may produce false positives on motorways ending in cities but it can be a valuable tool for looking up unwanted connections of motorways and other roads."

CHECK_0280_FILE="0280_boundaries.php"
CHECK_0280_DESCRIPTION="Administrative Boundaries can be expressed either by tagging ways or by adding them to a relation. They should be closed-loop sequences of ways, they must not self-intersect or split and they must have a name and an admin_level."

CHECK_0290_FILE="0290_restrictions.php"
CHECK_0290_DESCRIPTION="This check is about turn restrictions defined by relations. A turn restriction relation needs a valid type attribute, a way as 'from' member, another way as 'to' member and optionally one or more ways or nodes as via members that need to be connected to 'from' and 'to'"
