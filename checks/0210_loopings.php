/*

there should be two types of ways:
1) straight ways like A,B,C,D
2) closed loop ways like A,B,C,D,A

anything else like A,B,C,D,A,B looks like an error.

So any way may contain up to one node twice at most.
If any node is found more than twice in the same way or
if more than one node is found twice it looks like an error.
