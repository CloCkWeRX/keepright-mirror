ToDo:


* check for ways that contain some segments more than once. eg. way #26458524
  has nodes 289957357, 289957358, 289957359, 289957360, 289957361,
  289957357, 289957361
  http://openstreetmap.org/edit?lat=48.23257100588562&lon=16.314874335681896&zoom=18

* check for ways where at least 2 nodes in the way are tagged the same way (eg. way #26825583)
this way should be split up into a paved and an unpaved way-part

* comment found in run-checks.php just before error_view is created:
// * for relations I don't yet have an idea how to locate them in the map...
	locate them using its members.


* Check 50a:
find short zipferl of ways: unconnected last segments of ways, whose length is minimal.
Many junctions between ways show zipferl that are not connected and almost invisible.
eg. way #4985478 and #4985479
http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?lat=48.341073&lon=16.824228&zoom=18

way not connected at the first node but on the second (third?) node
and first segment is very short




* multipolygon relations with unclosed ways
* multipolygon relations with no or more than one way of role=outer
* Dont complain about unnamed way on highway=* junction=roundabout
* node inside of area of the same type. For example node with amenity=parking inside of area with amenity=parking. Fix is by either removing the node or by using Relations/Proposed/Label
* Shops, Car Parks which are not connected by a highway 


* objects containing duplicated tags 
http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.5/way/23950375
contains name = Haarholzer Straße, name = Haarholzer Straße

* misspelled tags
	tags that have levenshtein-distance == 1 to one of well-known tags
	well-known tags:
		exist for keys, where max(count(v)) >> 1
		top 10 keys that suffice for 90% of all records


* crossings of highway=motorway with other than highway=motorway-trunk or highway=motorway
especially with highway=residential
