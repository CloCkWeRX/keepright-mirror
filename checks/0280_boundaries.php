/*
-------------------------------------
-- errors on boundaries
-------------------------------------

* missing name
* missing admin_level
* not all members part of the relation
* more than one relation of same name and admin_level
* relation not closed-loop
* a tagged way may not be member of a relation of lower admin_level

about direction of ways:
it is annoying that member ways of boundary-relations may have
the wrong direction. But that's a problem, you cannot solve if a
single way can be member of more than one boundary at the same time:

        +--->------->---+
        |               |
        ^               v
        |               |
        +--><------><---+
        |               |
        ^               v
        |               |
        +-------<-------+

The middle way has always the wrong direction!
So we have to live with that...
