/*

-------------------------------------
-- language of value in name tag unknown
-------------------------------------

where an object has both 'name' and 'name:xx' but they are
different strings, the language of the main name should be specified.
So this would be incorrect:

    name=London
    name:fr=Londres

the check warns that the two strings are different, and that an explicit
tag should be added to show the language of the main name:

    name=London
    name:en=London
    name:fr=Londres

This helps applications to choose the appropriate name to show to the user.
