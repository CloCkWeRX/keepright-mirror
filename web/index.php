<img src="keepright.png" alt="keep-right logo">data consistency checks for <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OSM</a><hr>

This pages show checks that are run on a local excerpt database filled with OSM data. Checks are run on a database containing just the Europe part of the planet file for performance and memory reasons.
<br><br>
I'm proud to offer you two ways of accessing check results
<ul>
	<li><a href="report.php">Europe Data Checks as ugly list</a></li>
	<li><a href="report_map.php">Europe Data Checks painted on the map</a></li>
</ul>
By default you will be put into the center of Vienna.<br>

<h4>a few words on the new comment feature</h4>
Please give a comment that helps me improve the check routines if you find a false-positive. Don't confuse the comment box with an editing feature. This is not potlatch! You cannot add missing tags via keepright!

An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of march 31th 2009.<br><br>
Please welcome a new check called "misspelled tags". This one tries to find typos in keys and values. Keys and values are split up into two groups: common (frequently used) and uncommon (infrequently used) ones. This check will complain about uncommon keys or values that differ by just one character from a common key or value. It doesn't make sense to look for differences on numbers in this way, so any combination of numbers is replaced by 0. Don't get confused by zeroes in error messages, they are just placeholders!<br><br>
Did you ever wonder why errors on relations were seen so rarely? Well, up to now not a single error on relations was shown on the map because I had no idea where to put the marker. To solve this I put the markers on the center of gravity of all nodes referenced by the relation. Although this may not be ideal for circular routes as the marker is placed in the center, it is better than nothing... Thank you, Michel, for remining me of that issue!

An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of march 25th 2009. Because of my fault this is only a partial update. Checks floating islands, intersections without junctions and overlapping ways are still in the state of last week.<br><br>

<br><br>For archeologists: <a href="logs.php">Old log entries</a> have moved.


<h3>Currently the following checking procedures are implemented</h3>
<?php

require('webconfig.inc.php');
require('helpers.inc.php');

$db1=mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

$result=query("SELECT error_type, error_name, error_description FROM $error_types_name ORDER BY error_type", $db1, false);
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
	echo '<p><b>' . $row['error_name'] . '</b><br>' . $row['error_description'] . '</p>';
}

mysqli_free_result($result);
mysqli_close($db1);
?>


<!-- <h3>Source files</h3>

If you like to try running data consistency checks by yourself you may <a href="keepright.tar.gz">download the source files</a>. Please refer to the README file for detailed installation instructions.<br><br> -->

If you find an error in my errors lists I would definitely like to hear about it!<br>


<h3>Impressum</h3>
This work is done without commercial background, just for my personal pleasure. I would be very happy if it was helpful for the OSM Project.<br><br>
If you like to contact me, my mailbox at the austrian server of gmx is labelled keepright.
Please understand that I will not always be able to immediately respond to your mail on weekdays.
