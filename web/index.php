<img src="keepright.png" alt="keep-right logo">data consistency checks for <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OSM</a><hr>

These pages show checks that are run on a local excerpt database filled with OSM data. Checks are run on a database containing just the Europe part of the planet file for performance and memory reasons.

<div style="border:thin solid #800000; background-color:#80FF80;">Please welcome the first Keepright partner site providing error checks for <a href="http://keepright.x10hosting.com" target="_blank">Australia</a><br><br>Want to become a partner too?

By default you will be put into the center of Vienna for the European version.<br>

<h4>a few words on the new comment feature</h4>
Please give a comment that helps me improve the check routines if you find a false-positive. Don't confuse the comment box with an editing feature. This is not potlatch! You cannot add missing tags via keepright!

An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of april 28th 2009.<br><br>
Waterways are included by now in the checks 'intersections without junctions' and 'overlapping ways'. This will identify spots where bridges are missing.

An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of april 19th 2009.<br><br>
Some checks are modified this week:<br>
* 'almost junctions' will not complain about end-nodes that are tagged as bus stop or as amenity any more. There were many errors on short linking ways connecting amenities with the nearest road (see an <a target="_blank" href="http://openstreetmap.org/?lat=53.597046&lon=9.984201&zoom=18&layers=B000FTF">example</a>). In my opinion these short ways are not necessary but it is not the purpose of this check to show them. Thank you, SÃ¶ren for the tip!<br>
* 'points of interest without name' will not complain about amenity=bank where the name tag is missing any more. Instead it will require the operator tag to be set. Don't panic about numerous new error markers! Consider it just as a notice... Thank you, Hans for the tip!<br>
* 'intersections without junctions/overlapping ways' won't complain about junctions/overlappings between highways and areas. For example a street leading across a square is a valid <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?lat=50.7352246&lon=7.0983218&zoom=19&way=4801445&way=4935206">exception</a> as well as two squares tagged as highway sharing a way segment on their border (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?lat=50.733607&lon=7.10003&zoom=19&way=23659367">example</a>). Thank you, Peter for the tip!

<h3>Currently the following checking procedures are implemented</h3>
<?php

require('webconfig.inc.php');
require('helpers.inc.php');

$db1=mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

$result=query("SELECT error_type, error_name, error_description FROM $error_types_name ORDER BY error_type", $db1, false);
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
	echo '<p><b>' . $row['error_name'] . '</b><br>' . $row['error_description'] . '</p>';
}

mysqli_free_result($result);
mysqli_close($db1);
?>


<!-- <h3>Source files</h3>

If you like to try running data consistency checks by yourself you may <a href="keepright.tar.gz">download the source files</a>. Please refer to the README file for detailed installation instructions.<br><br> -->

If you find an error in my errors lists I would definitely like to hear about it!<br>


<h3>Impressum</h3>
