These pages show checks that are run on a local excerpt database filled with OSM data.

Developers have a look at the <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/keepright/">sourceforge</a> site providing svn access to the sources.

Introducing warnings<br>
There are two new checks online that produce more fuzzy results than the other checks do. These are &apos;multiple nodes at the same spot&apos; and &apos;missing maxspeed tag&apos;. Obviously not every of these warnings can or should be fixed. That is why they are turned off by default.<br>
Please never never change the map just to make keepright happy! Do it only if you know you fix an error. Maybe keepright is wrong. If you think so, please tell me and let me fix keepright.

After one month without any updates for Northern America I'm back on regular operations now. Delay was caused by troubles with updating planet files with diffs but are solved now with help from the dev mailing list. Thank you, Lennard, Frederik and Brett!<br>
The floating islands check will consider ways that are part of relations tagged with route=ferry even though the ways themselves don&apos;t have a railway=ferry tag. Thank you, Simon, for the suggestion!<br>
The almost-junction-check now not only ignores ways tagged with noexit=yes but also those tagged with highway=turning_circle. Thank you, Riccardo, for the suggestion!

<br><br>For archeologists: <a href="logs.php">Old log entries</a> have moved.

<h4>a few words on the new comment feature</h4>
Please give a comment that helps me improve the check routines if you find a false-positive. Don't confuse the comment box with an editing feature. This is not potlatch! You cannot add missing tags via keepright!
<br><br>
Please note that in order to make the JOSM link work, JOSM must already be running when you hit the JOSM-link. Furthermore you have to enable the &apos;remote control&apos;-plugin in JOSMs options.

<h3>Currently the following checking procedures are implemented</h3>
<?php

require('webconfig.inc.php');
require('helpers.inc.php');

$db1=mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);
mysqli_query($db1, "SET SESSION wait_timeout=60");

$result=query("
	SELECT error_type, error_name, error_description
	FROM $error_types_name 
	WHERE error_type=10*FLOOR(error_type/10)
	ORDER BY error_type
	", $db1, false);
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
	echo '<p><b>' . $row['error_name'] . '</b><br>' . $row['error_description'] . '</p>';
}

mysqli_free_result($result);
mysqli_close($db1);
?>



If you find an error in my errors lists I would definitely like to hear about it!<br>


<h3>Impressum</h3>
This work is done without commercial background, just for my personal pleasure. I would be very happy if it was helpful for the OSM Project.<br><br>
