<h4>2009-08-29</h4>
There&apos;s a new check that looks for errors on administrative boundaries. It complains about missing names and admin_levels as well as non-closed loops on boundary ways. <br>At the moment there are (at least) two ways of tagging boundaries: direct way tagging and relations. Both are considered valid and both methods are included in this check.<br><br>
A minor improvement to the loopings-check was suggested by Sebastiaan: Any way with only 2 different nodes in it, having one node more than once, is an error. Thank you!


<h4>2009-08-13</h4>
After a long discussion about the layers check I just removed the &quot;not so obvious&quot; part of the check. 
from now on, this is (again) correct:
<pre>
way A, layer 0	|
 		|           way B, layer 1
		|
 		*------------------------------------
		|
		|

</pre>
Intersections of ways on different layers are still not OK, if way A and B share a common node and intersect at intermediate nodes:
<pre>
 way A, layer 0	|
 		|           way B, layer 1
		|
 	--------*------------------------------------
		|
		|
</pre>
sorry for the confusion and thanks for the discussion!

<h4>a few words on the new comment feature</h4>
Please give a comment that helps me improve the check routines if you find a false-positive. Don't confuse the comment box with an editing feature. This is not potlatch! You cannot add missing tags via keepright!
<br><br>
Please note that in order to make the JOSM link work, JOSM must already be running when you hit the JOSM-link. Furthermore you have to enable the &apos;remote control&apos;-plugin in JOSMs options.

<h3>Currently the following checking procedures are implemented</h3>
<?php

require('webconfig.inc.php');
require('helpers.inc.php');

$db1=mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);
mysqli_query($db1, "SET SESSION wait_timeout=60");

$result=query("
	SELECT error_type, error_name, error_description
	FROM $error_types_name 
	WHERE error_type=10*FLOOR(error_type/10)
	ORDER BY error_type
	", $db1, false);
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
	echo '<p><b>' . $row['error_name'] . '</b><br>' . $row['error_description'] . '</p>';
}

mysqli_free_result($result);
mysqli_close($db1);
?>



If you find an error in my errors lists I would definitely like to hear about it!<br>

This work is done without commercial background, just for my personal pleasure. I would be very happy if it was helpful for the OSM Project.<br><br>
