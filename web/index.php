These pages show checks that are run on a local excerpt database filled with OSM data. Checks are run on a database containing just the Europe part of the planet file for performance and memory reasons.
<br><br>

<div style="border:thin solid #800000; background-color:#80FF80;">Please welcome the first Keepright partner site providing error checks for <a href="http://keepright.x10hosting.com" target="_blank">Australia</a><br><br>Want to become a partner too? Want to have a look into the sources behind keepright? Have a look at the <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/keepright/">sourceforge</a> site providing svn access, a mailing list and a trac ticket request system</div>

By default you will be put into the center of Vienna for the European version.<br>

<h4>a few words on the new comment feature</h4>
Please give a comment that helps me improve the check routines if you find a false-positive. Don't confuse the comment box with an editing feature. This is not potlatch! You cannot add missing tags via keepright!

The misspelled-tags check learned a new feature: It will complain about tags where the key is &quot;key&quot;. That are 1341 ways and 436 nodes in Europe. Thank you, Matthias for the tip!<br>
'Intersections without junctions' and 'overlapping ways' were expanded to find errors on waterways two weeks ago. Some of the newly found errors were false-positives (overlappings of riverbanks, intersections of waterways and riverbanks for example) and are removed now. The rest is now splitted to sub-types you can switch on and off individually as you prefer. Thank you, again, Hans for the valuable input!<br>
As the number of checkboxes got rather large, there is a new style of display. You can collapse the subtypes if you like. As soon as a well suited grouping scheme is found, the errors could be organized in groups reflecting a hierarchy by topic, but I'm still thinking about this. Comments are welcome!

Waterways are included by now in the checks 'intersections without junctions' and 'overlapping ways'. This will identify spots where bridges are missing.


<br><br>For archeologists: <a href="logs.php">Old log entries</a> have moved.


<h3>Currently the following checking procedures are implemented</h3>
<?php

require('webconfig.inc.php');
require('helpers.inc.php');

$db1=mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

$result=query("SELECT error_type, error_name, error_description FROM $error_types_name ORDER BY error_type", $db1, false);
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
	echo '<p><b>' . $row['error_name'] . '</b><br>' . $row['error_description'] . '</p>';
}

mysqli_free_result($result);
mysqli_close($db1);
?>


<!-- <h3>Source files</h3>

If you like to try running data consistency checks by yourself you may <a href="keepright.tar.gz">download the source files</a>. Please refer to the README file for detailed installation instructions.<br><br> -->

If you find an error in my errors lists I would definitely like to hear about it!<br>
