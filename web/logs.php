Another new check slowly appears on the maps these days: The roundabout check. It will complain about roundabouts that are not closed-loop or roundabouts that go the wrong way around. For the latter it is important to know if it is a right or left hand traffic country. I&apos;ve done my best to evaluate country boundaries to do this job but I&apos;m afraid, that is not perfect.
<br>
The &apos;multiple nodes at the same spot&apos; check is not yet visible because I simply forgot to enable it. So it will take a few more days until the new warnings pop up. Thank you, Peter, for reminding me!

<br><br>

<h4>2010-02-07</h4>
Introducing warnings<br>
There are two new checks online that produce more fuzzy results than the other checks do. These are &apos;multiple nodes at the same spot&apos; and &apos;missing maxspeed tag&apos;. Obviously not every of these warnings can or should be fixed. That is why they are turned off by default.<br>
Please never never change the map just to make keepright happy! Do it only if you know you fix an error. Maybe keepright is wrong. If you think so, please tell me and let me fix keepright.

<br><br>

<h4>2009-12-27</h4>
After one month without any updates for Northern America I'm back on regular operations now. Delay was caused by troubles with updating planet files with diffs but are solved now with help from the dev mailing list. Thank you, Lennard, Frederik and Brett!<br>
The floating islands check will consider ways that are part of relations tagged with route=ferry even though the ways themselves don&apos;t have a railway=ferry tag. Thank you, Simon, for the suggestion!<br>
The almost-junction-check now not only ignores ways tagged with noexit=yes but also those tagged with highway=turning_circle. Thank you, Riccardo, for the suggestion!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-11-16</h4>
With today&apos;s update I introduce a new kind of cutting the planet into manageable parts. Checking is done on rectangular parts that overlap at their borders. Errors in the overlapping regions are discarded because they are supposed to come from cutting inconsistencies. So errors at country borders should disappear. Maybe you find some new(?) at my new <a target="_blank" href="planet.jpg">cutting borders</a>. If so please tell me via e9625163 at gmx at. For now this is only valid for Europe, the rest will follow.

<br><br>

<h4>2009-11-16</h4>
The German errors table is now fixed with a complete run based on yesterday&apos;s planet file. Thank you, Norbert for telling me about the problem!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-11-15</h4>
To all the German users:<br>
The last database update went wrong and you will see only a fraction of the number of errors as you would expect. I have to re-run the checking to correct this so please be patient until Monday evening or Tuesday.<br>Sorry und nix f&uuml;r ungut!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-10-01</h4>
I&apos;m proud to announce that finally the first run for The United States of America is finished. Keepright now covers all of the planet!<br>
The procedure took 12 days to complete, so please be patient for the next update to come in (almost) two weeks.

<br><br>

<h4>2009-09-27</h4>
I&apos;m proud to announce that Canada and Central America are now part of the checking process schedule. Please find the links on top of the page and have fun!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-09-21</h4>
After a break there is again an update for the error tables. The delay was caused by restructuring work on the scripts wich are necessary for checking US states in the future. European countries are now checked individually, the results are put together into one big results table afterwards.<br>If you find any strange errors, especially near country borders, I would like to know!<br>
Thank you for your patience.<br>
<b>&lt;edit&gt;</b>you <i>will</i> find strange errors near the country borders. In fact there are issues with floating islands, ways without nodes and maybe more checks that are caused by truncated ways. I'm looking for a solution for this. Please be careful near country borders in the meantime! Thank you, Armin, for telling me.<b>&lt;/edit&gt;</b>

<br><br>

<h4>2009-08-29</h4>
There&apos;s a new check that looks for errors on administrative boundaries. It complains about missing names and admin_levels as well as non-closed loops on boundary ways. <br>At the moment there are (at least) two ways of tagging boundaries: direct way tagging and relations. Both are considered valid and both methods are included in this check.<br><br>
A minor improvement to the loopings-check was suggested by Sebastiaan: Any way with only 2 different nodes in it, having one node more than once, is an error. Thank you!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-08-13</h4>
After a long discussion about the layers check I just removed the &quot;not so obvious&quot; part of the check. 
from now on, this is (again) correct:
<pre>
way A, layer 0	|
 		|           way B, layer 1
		|
 		*------------------------------------
		|
		|

</pre>
Intersections of ways on different layers are still not OK, if way A and B share a common node and intersect at intermediate nodes:
<pre>
 way A, layer 0	|
 		|           way B, layer 1
		|
 	--------*------------------------------------
		|
		|
</pre>
sorry for the confusion and thanks for the discussion!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-08-03</h4>
I just published a minor update that cleans up the levels check and the motorways check:<br>
Not only highways but also landuse ways were included in the layers conflict check. This was not intended and is now fixed. Thank you, Norbert, for the hint!<br>Motorways that are continued by highway=trunk roads are not reported as error any more as this seems to be a common case. Thank you, Jean-Luc, for the hint!<br><br>

<br><br>

<h4>2009-08-01</h4>
There was some discussion going on about the layers check without a clear conclusion (at least for me). So please take the layers check as a warning, not as an error. It&apos;s just saying that there are ways on different layers that are connected. Please decide on your own, if that&apos;s OK.<br><br>
There is a new check that looks for motorways that are connected to other ways by accidant (this easily happens at bridges crossing motorways). Again, this check is not always right. Motorways that end somewhere may continue in a primary road.

<br><br>

<h4>2009-07-25</h4>
With today's update I introduce a new check that looks for ways that are connected but reside on different layers. There seems to be a difference between what the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tunnel" target="_blank">wiki says</a> and what's <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?zoom=18&lat=48.20244&lon=16.40252" target="_blank">common practice</a>.<br>
So I split the check in cases where ways intersect on in-between-nodes ("obviously wrong") and ways that start in a common node ("not so obvious").<br>
Thank you, Christian, for the idea to this check!

<br><br>

<h4>2009-07-21</h4>
There is a new link that will bring you immediately back to the error you're visiting at the moment. Find the link at the bottom of the error bubble. Thank you, Rejo, for the suggestion!

An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of july 13th 2009.<br>
During the last three weeks some errors were not updated correctly because of my wrong use of <tt>wput</tt>. This is now resolved.

The misspelled-tags check learned a new feature: It will complain about tags where the key is &quot;key&quot;. That are 1341 ways and 436 nodes in Europe. Thank you, Matthias for the tip!<br>
'Intersections without junctions' and 'overlapping ways' were expanded to find errors on waterways two weeks ago. Some of the newly found errors were false-positives (overlappings of riverbanks, intersections of waterways and riverbanks for example) and are removed now. The rest is now splitted to sub-types you can switch on and off individually as you prefer. Thank you, again, Hans for the valuable input!<br>
As the number of checkboxes got rather large, there is a new style of display. You can collapse the subtypes if you like. As soon as a well suited grouping scheme is found, the errors could be organized in groups reflecting a hierarchy by topic, but I'm still thinking about this. Comments are welcome!

Some checks are modified this week:<br>
* 'almost junctions' will not complain about end-nodes that are tagged as bus stop or as amenity any more. There were many errors on short linking ways connecting amenities with the nearest road (see an <a target="_blank" href="http://openstreetmap.org/?lat=53.597046&lon=9.984201&zoom=18&layers=B000FTF">example</a>). In my opinion these short ways are not necessary but it is not the purpose of this check to show them. Thank you, Sören for the tip!<br>
* 'points of interest without name' will not complain about amenity=bank where the name tag is missing any more. Instead it will require the operator tag to be set. Don't panic about numerous new error markers! Consider it just as a notice... Thank you, Hans for the tip!<br>
* 'intersections without junctions/overlapping ways' won't complain about junctions/overlappings between highways and areas. For example a street leading across a square is a valid <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?lat=50.7352246&lon=7.0983218&zoom=19&way=4801445&way=4935206">exception</a> as well as two squares tagged as highway sharing a way segment on their border (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?lat=50.733607&lon=7.10003&zoom=19&way=23659367">example</a>). Thank you, Peter for the tip!

<h4>2009-04-06</h4>
Just added an updated version of "dead-ended one-ways" errors. The check now includes motorways and motorway_links, which are regarded as one-way streets implicitly. Second there is a new part that searches for colliding one-way streets (one-ways pointing to a single node that cannot be left or from a single node that cannot be reached). Thank you, Ossi, for that hint!

<h4>2009-04-05</h4>
Just added an updated version of "misspelled tags" errors. Because of user feedback I removed some false positives.

<h4>2009-04-04</h4>
An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of march 31th 2009.<br><br>
Please welcome a new check called "misspelled tags". This one tries to find typos in keys and values. Keys and values are split up into two groups: common (frequently used) and uncommon (infrequently used) ones. This check will complain about uncommon keys or values that differ by just one character from a common key or value. It doesn't make sense to look for differences on numbers in this way, so any combination of numbers is replaced by 0. Don't get confused by zeroes in error messages, they are just placeholders!<br><br>
Did you ever wonder why errors on relations were seen so rarely? Well, up to now not a single error on relations was shown on the map because I had no idea where to put the marker. To solve this I put the markers on the center of gravity of all nodes referenced by the relation. Although this may not be ideal for circular routes as the marker is placed in the center, it is better than nothing... Thank you, Michel, for remining me of that issue!

<h4>2009-03-29</h4>
An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of march 25th 2009. Because of my fault this is only a partial update. Checks floating islands, intersections without junctions and overlapping ways are still in the state of last week.<br><br>

Checks "missing tags" and "highway without ref tag" were redefined and relaxed to better fit real life: "missing tags" won't complain on multipolygon ways tagged as "role inner". "highway without ref tag" does now accept motorways as correctly tagged if any of ref, nat_ref or int_ref tags exist. This change removes 11.686 errors for "missing tags" and 97.054 for "highway without ref tag". Thank you, Ulf, Dermot and Jean-Luc!
<br><br>

<h4>2009-03-07</h4>
An updated errors-table went online today! Planet dump was updated as of march 2nd 2009. Due to an error in the scripts many errors were invisible up to now. Thank you, Hans, for the hint! <br><br>

Furthermore a completely rewritten user interface is in place now. This work evolved in cooperation with Hans, who provided valuable input and beta testing feedback. Thank you!<br>
For those who want to find out how much better the new interface is: You can still use the <a href="report_map1.php">old version</a>, but you should not.<br><br>
You may now mark errors as 'temporarily ignorable' if you just corrected the error and don't want other users to loose time with this issue. These errors will be removed from the map if they are indeed closed, otherwise they will jump back to open state during the next update.<br>If you find a false positive, please mark it as 'permanently ignorable' and please give a short comment that helps me improve my check routines!

<li>A new check is included to find ways that include individual nodes more than once (loops). This check doesn't provide error messages, just warnings. It is common practice to map isolated parts of areas as leafs connected by a zero-width stalk using the same nodes twice -- I don't want to critisise these. But there are other cases where loops are built accidently.</li>
